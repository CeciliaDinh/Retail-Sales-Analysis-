# 🧠 Retail Profit Optimization Project

This project aims to analyze 4 years of transactional data from a retail store, identify profitability issues, and generate actionable strategies to maximize profit.

## 🔍 Business Context

Despite having a decent revenue stream, the store suffers from low profit margins (currently ~12%). Initial analysis shows:

- Discounts increase quantity purchased (positive Pearson correlation),
- But they correlate negatively with both revenue and profit,
- Many loss-making orders are concentrated around:
  - Discounts > 20%,
  - Bulk purchases (above 75th percentile in quantity).

## 🎯 Project Objectives

1. **Optimize Revenue**  
   - Identify high-performing and high-margin products  
   - Prioritize scalable products not reliant on discounting

2. **Optimize Marketing Spend (Voucher ROI)**  
   - Evaluate cost-effectiveness of discounts  
   - Detect high-discount orders that lead to losses  
   - Propose refined voucher strategy based on ROI

3. **Segment Customers Based on Behavior**  
   - Go beyond the default segments (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office)  
   - Use clustering & PCA to identify behavior-driven customer personas  
   - Design sales/loyalty programs tailored to each segment
